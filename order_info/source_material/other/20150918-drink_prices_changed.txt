Hi there,


Following some debate over the past few days (and some calculations) a
handful of us decided we shall lower the prices of some drinks (and
evaluate later if we can keep that or not). The drinks that are now
cheaper are the 0.5l 'mate' bottles and the Fritz/Proviant/Sauer sleek
bottles. The prices of Ginger- and Rootbeer have NOT changed.

To also try to help solve the unclarity on drink prices, AND at the same
time tell people where their drink is stored, I went and printed 3
sheets with all beverages depicted in nice colored pictures. One sheet
per fridge, since all fridges store different drinks. This should help
find the drink. They have the new prices, but I have also ones with the
old prices should the need arise.

I updated the revbank product list too.

Note that some items are depicted on each sheet; liter bottles of coca
cola or orange juice can be in random fridges; the fact that it is shown
does not mean it IS there; it merely means it may be found there. If it
isn't depicted though, it really shouldn't be in there.

These sheets were meant to tell people the contents of the fridges;
you'll look in vain for coffee, tea, red wine, etc. I can make and print
one for that too, someone should then contact me and request it.

I hope it is to everyone's satisfaction. If not, reply here please.

Maarten
